# calculator
Project: Calculator from The Odin Project curriculum in the JavaScript
Basics section of the Foundations course.

Being the final project of the Foundations course, this calculator project
will put all of our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to the test. From
structuring all of the content with HTML, to adding styles to it with CSS
and laying the content out with flexbox, to manipulating the DOM and our
data and handling events by adding interaction with JavaScript.

After having completed the Etch-a-Sketch project that came before this one,
there was another lesson in the course that introduced us to objects and
to more advanced array methods for manipulating our data. As such, this
project will be a good practice for these newly learned concepts and skills.
